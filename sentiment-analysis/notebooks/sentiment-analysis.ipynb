    "## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. [...] Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, more business oriented, [definition](https://www.paralleldots.com/sentiment-analysis) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [The goal of sentiment analysis is to] understand the social sentiment of your brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. Sentiment Analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material."

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will perform a kind of \"reverse sentiment analysis\" on a dataset consisting of movie review from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). The dataset already contains the classification, which can be positive or negative, and the task at hand is to identify which words appear more frequently on reviews from each of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the [Naive Bayes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) will be used, more specifically the [Bernoulli Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Bernoulli_naive_Bayes). From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent binary variables describing inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore,\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $x_i$ is a boolean expressing the occurrence or absence of the $i$-th term from the vocabulary, then the likelihood of a document given a class $C_{k}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p({x_1}, \\ldots ,{x_n}\\mid {C_k}) = \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^n {p_{ki}^{{x_i}}} {(1 - {p_{ki}})^{(1 - {x_i})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_{{ki}}$ is the probability that a review $k$ belonging to class $C_{k}$ contains the term $x_{i}$. The classification $C_{1}$ is either 0 or 1 (negative or positive). In other words, the Bernoulli NB will tell us which words are more likely to appear *given that* the review is \"fresh\" versus or given that it is \"rotten\"."
